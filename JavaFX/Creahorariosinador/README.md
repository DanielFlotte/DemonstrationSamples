## JavaFX GUI demonstration
There was a small problem by creating our class schedule due to the high complexity of it. There ware so many possible combinations, and what we wanted was to increase the number of classes to take and reduce the number of free hours as much as posible. This small JavaFX program solve it with a nice GUI that can save and load schedule's (see images to see runing samples.)

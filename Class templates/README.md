## Class templates in C++ demonstration

The class "Top" (Top.hpp) is a special type of container that saves the n best elements of any kind. 
If you declare a Top\<int\> with 5 max elements, and you insert {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} when you iterate in the Top, you will have the elements {3, 4, 5, 6, 10} sorted.
